# Inspect metadata

We use additional target annotations available from clue.io/repurposing
to produce

1.  An expanded set of target annotations:
    `output/JUMP-Target_compound_metadata_all_targets.csv`, along with
    two different versions of the same information that are easier to
    browse:
    `output/JUMP-Target_compound_metadata_all_targets_per_compound.csv`
    and
    `output/JUMP-Target_compound_metadata_all_targets_per_target.csv`
2.  An expanded set of connections between ORFs, CRISPRs, and compounds:
    `output/JUMP-Target_compounds_crispr_orf_connections.csv`, along
    with different version of the same information, stored as a gene x
    compound matrix: `output/JUMP-Target_gene_compound_matrix.csv`
